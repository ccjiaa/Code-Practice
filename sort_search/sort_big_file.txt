#When sorting a large file, I would use quick sort
#This is because the two common most efficient sorting methods are quick sort and merge sort (and heap sort, but I'm not yet as familiar with it)
#The reason why quick sort is better than merge sort here is because merge sort has O(N) space complexity
#So, if we were to have to sort a 20GB file, we would need 20GB of auxillary space, which is not ideal
#Quick sort, on the other hand, has a higher worse case time, so it may on average be a bit slower than merge sort
#However, it does not use large amounts of extra space, and still still very efficient
#Thus, to sort a large file, I would use quick sort
